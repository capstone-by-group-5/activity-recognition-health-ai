Activity Recognition Inference

This module performs activity recognition based on the trained model. Given new sensor data,
the trained model is used to predict the activity being performed.

Functions:
- load_model(): Loads the pre-trained model for inference.
- preprocess_input(): Preprocesses the input data before passing it to the model.
- recognize_activity(): Recognizes the activity from the input data using the trained model.
- display_result(): Displays the predicted activity.
