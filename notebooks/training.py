Model Training for Human Activity Recognition

This module handles the training of machine learning models for activity recognition
using the preprocessed data. It includes functions for defining, training, and saving
the model.

Functions:
- build_model(): Defines the machine learning model architecture.
- train_model(): Trains the model using the training data.
- save_model(): Saves the trained model for future inference.
- evaluate_model(): Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.
