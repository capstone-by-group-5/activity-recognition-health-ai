This module handles the preprocessing of raw sensor data collected from wearable devices.
The main functions include cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, and data splitting
for model training and evaluation.

Functions:
- clean_data(): Cleans the raw sensor data by handling missing values, removing outliers, etc.
- normalize_data(): Normalizes the data to a common scale.
- extract_features(): Extracts relevant features from the raw sensor data.
- split_data(): Splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
